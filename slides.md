# Introduction

## Understanding Brain Organoids

An **artificially grown**, **in vitro**, tissue resembling parts of the human brain.

# Introduction

## What's the Barriers?

- Physically hard to construct.

- Functionally hard to develop.

# Introduction

## Possible Solution

- Physically: Focusing on reconstructing a **specific brain region**.

# Introduction

## Possible Solution

- Functionally: **Actively "train"** the organoid besides natural development.

# Background
## Free Energy Principle

- Author: Karl Friston (2010)
- A normative theory on **living organism's** intelligence
- Derived from a specific form of **variational bayesian inference**.

# Background
## Free Energy Principle
  - Bayesian Brain Hypothesis.
  - Self-Organized System **minimize** it's **free energy (surprise)**.


---

# Background
## Free Energy Principle

- Internal and external state are separated by **markov blanket**.

- Brain makes **variational bayesian inference**. 

- Brain fitting the world **as precise as possible**.

# Background
## Dish Brain

Training a BNN playing video game **based on FEP theory**.

# Proposed Approach

- Reconstruct organoid of a specific brain region in marco  morphology with emergence of the markers.

- Using external stimuli to help (train) the in virto organoid form the micro morphology (connections between neurons).


---

# Challenges and Considerations
   - Technical Challenges
     - Managing the complexity of chemical and electrical stimulations.
     - Ensuring reproducibility and scalability of the approach.
   - Ethical Considerations
     - Addressing ethical issues related to in-vitro brain organoid research.
   - Limitations of the Study
     - Potential constraints in fully replicating brain region functionalities.
